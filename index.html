        <h3>Direct-to-Object Printers</h3>
        <p>I contributed to the development of HMI interfaces and motion control programs for several direct-to-object printer models. I supported the design of control panel layouts, PLC programming, and error-proofing systems to enhance reliability and efficiency.</p>
        <p>One of the projects I worked on was the PeriQ360, a four-tunnel printer with six print heads per tunnel. This system utilized Parker linear drives, Kollmorgen rotary drives, and Trio-controlled stepper motors. My role included assisting with system setup, optimizing control parameters, and ensuring the system met performance expectations.</p>

        <h3>MiniP Printer</h3>
        <p>I worked on the MiniP Printer, a system with six print heads capable of printing on 3D media contours. My contributions included programming PLCs for synchronized motion control and helping optimize the system for consistent quality and throughput.</p>

        <h3>Turret Printer</h3>
        <p>This project involved a multi-station rapid printer that applied primer, CMYK, and clear coat. I supported the design and implementation of the control system, which included integrating PLCs and robotic components. I focused on ensuring the system operated efficiently at high speeds, achieving a rate of over one part per second.</p>

        <h3>Ball Cup Light Automation</h3>
		<p>I handled all the electrical and programming work for the UV inspection system at Ball Corporation. This included creating the line diagrams and ensuring that the system met the power requirements set by the relevant certifying bodies, including the National Electrical Code (NEC) and UL standards. My work ensured that the system operated reliably and met production standards for detecting micro-holes in cups at high speeds.</p>

        <h3>AutoCAD Excel Integration</h3>
        <p>I created Excel macros for automated electrical design generation, which reduced the time required to produce I/O line diagrams. These tools helped ensure accuracy and consistency across large-scale projects.</p>

        <h3>Chip Redesign for Ink Pumps</h3>
        <p>During the COVID circuit shortage, I redesigned a chip for ink pumps. The original circuit would start motors at 16V, causing excessive pressure and resulting in head weeping. When dropping to 12V, the motors would not run. By switching to PWM, I was able to run the motors at 12V without adjusting the voltage, reducing chip costs and significantly improving production efficiency. This change reduced construction time from 4 hours per board to 4 boards per hour.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <h3>Pressure Control System</h3>
<p>I designed a new pressure control board that replaced Brushless DC motors with stepper motors. This solution maintained pressure within 0.1 mBars of the target, improving the system's stability and reliability. Unlike Brushless DC motors, which would oscillate while attempting to maintain pressure and risk premature burnout, the stepper motors provided much more stable performance.</p>

        <h3>Tetris Vision Project</h3>
        <p>Using OpenCV, I explored creating a software-based recreation of a live Tetris game board. This project was a learning opportunity that allowed me to experiment with vision systems and real-time data processing.</p>

        <h3>Weekend Game Project</h3>
        <p>As a personal challenge, I created a simple game in C++ without using existing game engines. This project was a way to deepen my understanding of low-level programming and algorithm design.</p>
